DropShot is a Digital Ocean droplet management script. It allows you to spin up / down a droplet while maintaining a snapshot between doing so. This allows you to easily spin up your managed droplet when you need it. When you don't need it, you can spin it down to save costs.

This script will most likely have bugs at times due to the simple approach taken.
